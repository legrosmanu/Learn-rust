# Learn-rust

This repository is just to follow the [Rustlings courses](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/?tab=readme-ov-file).  
Of course, the first step is to [install Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).
Then, install rustings (```cargo install rustlings```), and run it with ```rustlings```.
