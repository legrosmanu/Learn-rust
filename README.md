# Learn-rust

This repository is just to follow the [Rustlings courses](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/?tab=readme-ov-file).  
To start, run ```rustlings``` command, after having installed it with ```cargo install rustlings```.  
Of course, after if you didn't install Rust, you'll have [to do it](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html)
